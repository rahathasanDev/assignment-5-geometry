        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold font-semibold "> What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p class=""><span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Ans:</span>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-neutral programming interface for accessing
            and manipulating documents. It represents a document as a tree-like structure of objects. The DOM defines
            the objects that comprise the document and their properties and methods. This allows programs and scripts to
            dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

            The DOM is used by web browsers to render web pages. It is also used by JavaScript and other scripting
            languages to dynamically interact with web pages.</p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold font-semibold "> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM
            methods.?</h1>
        <p><span class="text-2xl ">Ans:</span> DOM can select any HTML element and also change it's value . There are 5
            methods in Dom for select HTML element
        <ol class="list-disc px-12 mt-3 mb-3">
            <li>getElementById(): This method takes an ID as its argument and returns a reference to the element with
                that
                ID.</li>
            <li> getElementsByTagName(): This method takes a tag name as its argument and returns a collection of all
                elements with that tag name.</li>
            <li> getElementsByClassName(): This method takes a class name as its argument and returns a collection of
                all
                elements with that class name.</li>
            <li>querySelector(): This method takes a CSS selector as its argument and returns a reference to the first
                element that matches the selector.</li>
            <li> querySelectorAll(): This method takes a CSS selector as its argument and returns a collection of all
                elements that match the selector.</li>

        </ol>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold font-semibold "> What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p><span class="text-2xl ">Ans:</span>
            Event bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model) that describes how events propagate through a
            document. When an event occurs on an element, it is first handled by that element. If the element has no
            event handler for the event, the event is then propagated to the element's parent. This process continues
            until the event reaches the top of the document tree, or until an element with an event handler for the
            event is encountered. </p>
        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold font-semibold "> What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
        <p><span class="text-2xl ">Ans:</span>
            Callback functions are a powerful tool that can be used to handle asynchronous events. They can make your
            code more modular and easier to read.
            <br><br>
            Here are some of the benefits of using callback functions:
        <ol>
            <li>1.They make your code more modular and easier to read.</li>
            <li> 2.They allow you to handle asynchronous events in a more efficient way.
            </li>
            <li> 3.They can be used to create reusable code.
            </li>
        </ol><br>
        Here are some of the drawbacks of using callback functions:
        <br> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1.They can be difficult to debug.</li>
            <li> 2.They can be difficult to understand, especially for beginners.
            </li>
            <li> 3.They can make your code more complex.
            </li>

        </ol>
